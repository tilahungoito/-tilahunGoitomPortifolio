        excerpt: "How I architected a production-grade, multi-tenant governance platform for the Ethiopian Ministry of Mines — featuring a 6-step GIS wizard, RBAC workflow engine, and immutable audit trail using Next.js and NestJS.",
        content: [
            "**Week 1 — Kickoff & Architecture Design**",
            "Day 1-2: Met with the Ministry of Mines stakeholders to gather requirements. The core need: a single digital portal replacing paper-based license applications that took months to process. Sketched a high-level diagram — NestJS backend, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL + PostGIS for spatial data.",
            "",
            "Day 3-4: Chose a multi-tenant design with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Roles defined: Applicant, Regional Officer, Senior Officer, Director, Finance. Each role sees only what they need — applied the principle of least privilege from day one.",
            "",
            "Day 5-7: Set up the monorepo, Prisma schema with 14 models, Docker Compose with PostGIS extension enabled. First migration ran cleanly.",
            "",
            "**Week 2 — The 6-Step GIS Wizard**",
            "Day 8-9: Built Step 1 (Company Registration) with form validation using Zod. Step 2 added file uploads (company registration certificate, tax clearance) with Multer + S3 presigned URLs.",
            "",
            "Day 10-12: The hardest part — Step 3, the GIS Map. Integrated Leaflet.js inside Next.js with a dynamic import (no SSR). Users draw polygons on a map to define their mine boundary. Used Turf.js to calculate area in hectares and check for overlapping claims in PostGIS.",
            "",
            "Day 13-14: Steps 4-6 cover mineral type selection, workflow submission, and an applicant dashboard showing real-time status. Added email notifications via Nodemailer at each workflow stage.",

            "**Week 3 — RBAC Workflow Engine**",
            "Day 15-17: Built the approval state machine: DRAFT → SUBMITTED → REGIONAL_REVIEW → SENIOR_REVIEW → DIRECTOR_APPROVAL → FINANCE_CLEARANCE → APPROVED. Each transition is validated server-side. No client can skip states.",
            "",
            "Day 18-19: Implemented an immutable audit trail. Every state change writes to an AuditLog table with actor ID, timestamp, old state, new state, and a SHA-256 hash of the record chain — tamper-evident.",
            "",
            "Day 20-21: Load-tested with k6 — 200 concurrent applications, average response 340ms. Optimised slow PostGIS overlap query with a GIST index: dropped from 2.1s to 180ms. 🚀",

            "",
            "Day 6-7: Created a reusable NestJS guard — 'ScopeGuard' — that intercepts every request and injects a WHERE clause into every Prisma query dynamically. This meant we never had to remember to filter by scope in each service method. 🔒",
            "",
            "**Week 2 — Student & Staff Management**",

            "",
            "Day 11-13: Staff management module — hire date, subject specialisation, salary grade. Built a transfer request workflow: a teacher applies for a transfer, the Woreda Admin approves/rejects, Institution Admins are notified. Used NestJS EventEmitter for decoupled notifications.",
            "",
            "Day 14: First weekly review with the Regional Education Bureau. Feedback: the dashboard was confusing. Redesigned the sidebar to show only links relevant to the logged-in user's scope. Simpler = better.",

            "**Week 3 — Academic Config & Grades**",
            "Day 15-17: Built Academic Year and Term configuration. Each institution sets its own calendar. Grade entry allows teachers to submit marks per student per subject. Used optimistic locking to prevent duplicate grade submissions.",
            "",
            "Day 18-20: Implemented the report card generation system — auto-calculates rank, GPA, pass/fail per subject using configurable pass-mark thresholds. PDF export using Puppeteer running inside Docker. First test report card printed in 1.8 seconds. 📄",
            "",
            "Day 21: Hotfix — discovered that Puppeteer in Alpine Linux Docker image was missing Chromium fonts for Amharic script. Fixed by installing 'fonts-noto-cjk' and adding a Dockerfile layer for Ethiopic font support.",

            "**Week 4 — Announcements, Analytics & Go-Live**",

            "",
            "Day 25-26: Analytics dashboard with Chart.js — enrollment trends, attendance rates, pass rates by Woreda. The Regional Bureau loved comparing Woredas side by side. Added drilldown to Zones on click.",
            "",
            "Day 27-28: Deployed on-premise (Bureau has its own servers, no cloud). Used Docker Compose. Ran initial data migration from their old Excel files — cleaned and imported 47,000 student records. System is live. 🌟",
